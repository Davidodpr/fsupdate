# Blueprint-templates 101
Blueprint templates is a way to create template files that can be used when creating new components, hooks, api-calls etc.
They are mostly useful for setting up files that contain mostly the same kind of "boilerplate" syntax for every instance of that file.

By creating a sub-folder under this folder, you can create template grouping of files to be created simoultaneously.
