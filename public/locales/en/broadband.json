  "mobileOrFixed": "Fixed or mobile broadband?",
  "mobileOrFixed1": "The main thing that governs the choice between mobile or fixed broadband is how you will use the broadband. If you are often on the move, and want to be able to be flexible, then mobile broadband is probably the best choice for you.",
  "mobileOrFixed2": "Apart from this, it is always the conditions at the address that govern. If there are no fixed alternatives, and it is not relevant to pull in fiber at the address, then mobile broadband may be your only choice.",
  "mobileOrFixed3": "However, if you have access to fiber and need fast transfer speeds and unlimited data, you should consider fixed broadband.",
  "suggestedPricePopupHeader": "What does the price mean?",
  "suggestedPricePopupText": "The monthly unit price is the sum of all costs during the binding period (or during the first year if the bidding period is shorter than 12 months), calculated per month. This includes both fixed start-up fees and ongoing monthly fees.",

    "whyOrder": "Is broadband included in my rent/monthly fee?",

    "whatHappensAfterOrderAnswer": "Many broadband subscriptions have a binding period (often 12, 18 or 24 months). This means that you will have to pay for this entire period, even if you want to cancel your subscription early.",
    "whatHappensAfterOrderAnswer_2": "Suppliers rarely make exceptions when it comes to binding periods. However, it is not impossible that you can move with your current subscription, or transfer it to the person who moves in after you. It is often possible to arrange directly on the supplier's website."
