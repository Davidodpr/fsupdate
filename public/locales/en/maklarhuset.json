Flyttsmart ensures that customers receive help with both termination and new contracts.\n\nEach unique power of attorney gives <strong>1 or 2 points</strong>, which means that a contract signing can give a maximum of <strong>2 points</strong>. <strong>1 point</strong> if the buyer signs the power of attorney (new contract) and <strong>1 point</strong> if the seller signs the power of attorney (termination).\n\nThe broker who collects the most points between <strong>September 1st</strong> and <strong>November 30th</strong> wins a <span class=\"golden-ticket\">GOLDEN TICKET</span>, worth <span class=\"prize-money\">SEK 10,000</span>. We will also draw a bonus winner from all those who have submitted electricity powers of attorney, worth <span class=\"prize-money\">SEK 3,000</span>."
